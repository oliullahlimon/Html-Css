        <h1>Digital Image Processing</h1>
        <p>
            In computer science, digital image processing is the use of 
            computer algorithms to perform image processing on digital 
            images. As a subcategory or field of digital signal processing,
            digital image processing has many advantages over analog image 
            processing. It allows a much wider range of algorithms to be 
            applied to the input data and can avoid problems such as the 
            build-up of noise and signal distortion during processing. 
            Since images are defined over two dimensions (perhaps more) 
            digital image processing may be modeled in the form of 
            multidimensional systems.

        <p>
            Many of the techniques of digital image processing, or digital
            picture processing as it often was called, were developed in 
            the 1960s at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory, Massachusetts 
            Institute of Technology, Bell Laboratories, University of 
            Maryland, and a few other research facilities, with 
            application to satellite imagery, wire-photo standards 
            conversion, medical imaging, videophone, character 
            recognition, and photograph enhancement. The cost of 
            processing was fairly high, however, with the computing 
            equipment of that era.

            That changed in the 1970s, when digital image processing 
            proliferated as cheaper computers and dedicated hardware 
            became available. Images then could be processed in real time,
            for some dedicated problems such as television standards 
            conversion. As general-purpose computers became faster, they 
            started to take over the role of dedicated hardware for all 
            but the most specialized and computer-intensive operations. 
            With the fast computers and signal processors available in 
            the 2000s, digital image processing has become the most 
            common form of image processing and generally, is used 
            because it is not only the most versatile method, but also 
            the cheapest.

            Digital image processing technology for medical applications 
            was inducted into the Space Foundation Space Technology Hall 
            of Fame in 1994.
