            <h1>Digital image processing</h1>
            <p>
               In computer science, digital image processing is the use of computer algorithms 
               to perform image processing on digital images. As a subcategory or field of digital 
               signal processing, digital image processing has many advantages over analog image processing. 
               It allows a much wider range of algorithms to be applied to the input data and can avoid 
               problems such as the build-up of noise and signal distortion during processing. 
               Since images are defined over two dimensions (perhaps more) digital image processing 
               may be modeled in the form of multidimensional systems.

               Many of the techniques of digital image processing, or digital picture processing as it often was called, 
               were developed in the 1960s at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory, Massachusetts Institute of Technology, 
               Bell Laboratories, University of Maryland, and a few other research facilities, with application to 
               satellite imagery, wire-photo standards conversion, medical imaging, videophone, character recognition, 
               and photograph enhancement. The cost of processing was fairly high, however, with the computing equipment 
               of that era.

                That changed in the 1970s, when digital image processing proliferated as cheaper computers and dedicated 
                hardware became available. Images then could be processed in real time, for some dedicated problems such 
                as television standards conversion. As general-purpose computers became faster, they started to take over 
                the role of dedicated hardware for all but the most specialized and computer-intensive operations. 
                With the fast computers and signal processors available in the 2000s, digital image processing has 
                become the most common form of image processing and generally, is used because it is not only the 
                most versatile method, but also the cheapest.

                Digital image processing technology for medical applications was inducted into the Space Foundation 
                Space Technology Hall of Fame in 1994.
